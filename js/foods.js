        desc: `The first that comes in people's mind when they talk about Kathmanud's delicacies is surely Momo. While its origins are Tibetan, it has been integrated into the Nepali gastronomical journey thoroughly. They come in different shapes and sizes, but primarily you’ll find leaf-shaped or round momos being sold in street-shops and individual carts.
        Momos are meat/vegetable filled dough-balls, that are either steamed or fried, or even “kothey” - half-steamed, half-fried. A spicy, tangy tomato chutney accompanies them in most places, but depending on where you eat, these condiments may change their form and taste.`

It’s packed with heat and spice, so be sure you can take it before you gorge into it. This spicy, mouth- and the eye-watering dish is typically served with Chiura or flaked rice, that complements the soft, chewy meat well with its crunch. It is also accompanied by the traditional Newari homemade liquor- Aila. Choila has become a staple street dish in all of Nepal, brought there from traditional Newari homes and festivals. `

Sekuwa is made out of any meat, be it pork, lamb, goat or chicken (or a mixture). The raw meat is lathered with traditional herbs and spices, and grilled over a natural wood fire. The smell of the smoking, charred meat fills up streets, attracting crowds in large numbers. However, sekuwa is not readily available everywhere in Nepal, and one may have to do thorough research about its availability before venturing out to try it. "
